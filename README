Modular version of bootrap with minor differences.

Files starting with _ are meant to be included in other files

_global add a context to the final files such as colors, sizes, utility functions.
It can be included anywhere and wont generate any css alone.

When generating a build for your use you need to be aware of the
include chain in case you made modifications in _global included files.

To be sure you are up to date you need to compile the _* files first,
_global right after that, then your final less file.

Other minor difference/changes from boostrap:

- .clearfix form row, is called "form-row" now

To build use you favorite minifier/packing util or simply cat on the
resulting css files. Dont use less to concat the less files together
since global is included more than once it would cause less mixins
duplicates.
